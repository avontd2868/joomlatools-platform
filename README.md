Would you be willing to trade all the days from this day forward for one chance
-- just one chance -- to come back here and tell our enemies that they
may take our lives, but they'll never take our freedom?

Alba gu brÃ th!

[Joomlatools Platform] is a modern Joomla stack that helps you get started with the best development tools and project
structure.

Much of the philosophy behind the platform is inspired by the [Twelve-Factor App](http://12factor.net/) methodology
including the [Joomla specific version](https://www.joomlatools.com/developer/platform/).

> Forked from [Joomla CMS v3.6.5](https://github.com/joomla/joomla-cms/releases/tag/3.6.5)

## Features

### Joomlatools Console

Our [Joomlatools Console] also supports the Joomlatools Platform. To install the platform with a single command, add the `--repo=platform` flag:

    joomla site:create joomlatools-platform --repo=platform

## Configuration

To be able to access your Joomla site at `http://example.com/`set your site vhost document root
to `/path/to/site/web/`.

If you are using shared hosting and/or you are not allowed to change your server Apache vhost
configuration directly rename [htaccess.txt](htaccess.txt) to .htaccess and modify it use your
domain name to set web root or document root to /web.

## Deploys

There is currently one method to deploy platform sites out of the box:

* [joomlatools-console-capistrano](https://github.com/joomlatools/joomlatools-console-capistrano)

Any other deployment method can be used as well with one requirement:

`composer install` must be run as part of the deploy process.
